// # Raytracing
//
// **Raytracing** is a relatively simple way to render images of 3D objects.
// The core is an elegant idea, that one can simulate the real-world behavior
// of photons of light bouncing off of surfaces and colors accumulating from
// their paths. It's not inherently fast, but the simplicity of the core lets
// it model interesting things like reflections and depth of field in ways
// that mirror natural processes.
//
// ## CS 301: Raytracing
//
// This happens to be a popular subject for education: implementing a raytracer
// requires a student to understand vector math, fast code, and even recursion.
// The reward is a pretty image - more compelling than the blasé debug output
// that students get from most assignments.
//
// But it's still hard to learn: explanations are written either in the
// language of mathematics or programming, and rarely connect all the dots.
// Raytracer implementations tend to extremes: one
// [fits on a business card](http://fabiensanglard.net/rayTracing_back_of_business_card/),
// another [supports nearly every potential feature](http://www.povray.org/),
// and most of the rest are [homework assignments](https://github.com/search?q=raytracer+cs&ref=cmdform),
// implemented just enough to run, never enough to have comments and documentation.
//
// ## Literate Raytracer
//
// [Literate raytracer](https://github.com/tmcw/literate-raytracer) is a
// simple implementation of raytracing in Javascript. It's [made to be
// read as a narrative](http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/), and intends
// to [explain vector operations](http://macwright.org/literate-raytracer/vector.html) as well.

// # Setup
var c = document.getElementById('c'),
    width = 640 * 0.5,
    height = 480 * 0.5;

// Get a context in order to generate a proper data array. We aren't going to
// use traditional Canvas drawing functions like `fillRect` - instead this
// raytracer will directly compute pixel data and then put it into an image.

var scene = {};

//
// We need to define three different kinds of things in 3D space:
// a **camera** from which we cast rays into the scene, **objects**
// that can be hit by those rays and are drawn into the scene, and
// **lights** that change the color of rays, by extension coloring objects.
//
// In this case, we define these objects as simple objects with vectors
// defined as `{x, y, z}` objects.

// ## The Camera
//
// Our camera is pretty simple: it's a point in space, where you can imagine
// that the camera 'sits', a `fieldOfView`, which is the angle from the right
// to the left side of its frame, and a `vector` which determines what
// angle it points in.

    vector: {
        x: 0,
        y: 3,
        z: 0
    }
};

// ## Lights
//
// Lights are defined only as points in space - surfaces that have lambert
// shading will be affected by any visible lights.
scene.lights = [{
    x: -30,
    y: -10,
    z: 20
}];

// ## Objects
//
// This raytracer handles sphere objects, with any color, position, radius,
// and surface properties.
scene.objects = [
    {

// # Throwing Rays
//
// This is one part where we can't follow nature exactly: technically photons
// come out of lights, bounce off of objects, and then some hit the 'eye'
// and many don't. Simulating this - sending rays in all directions out of
// each light and most not having any real effect - would be too inefficient.
//
// Luckily, the reverse is more efficient and has practically the same result -
// instead of rays going 'from' lights to the eye, we follow rays from the eye
// and see if they end up hitting any features and lights on their travels.
//
// For each pixel in the canvas, there needs to be at least one ray of light
// that determines its color by bouncing through the scene.

    // interpolated between them in little increments.
    //
    // Starting with the height and width of the scene, the camera's place,
